## Project Description
This project is to build a game, especifically the Hangman.
Hangman is a really popular game with simple rules.

## Rules
The objective of the game is to guess the word.

For that, the player has to say letters out loud, if the letter is in the word to be guessed, great!! Less letters to be guessed, otherwise he looses one attempt (up to 9)

There is always the option to say the word directly, if the word to be guessed is different to the guess of the player, he has lost.

## Workflow
1st of all I researched a little bit about the game and then I created a game structure in order to know how exactly my code would look like (1st I draw the map in a paper and then, I designed (more or less) where I should implement a For loop, a function, and so on.
## Organization
I used Trello in order to know split the project into little tasks and to take everything into consideration.
My repository consists of a 2 files (gitignore and ReadME.md) and a folder named "code" where the Hangman's game is stored.1st
